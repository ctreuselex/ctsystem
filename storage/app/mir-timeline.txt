He, the  leader, and his gang of seven other men, one of which has escaped, were in the process of robbing a Myst Armament Manufacturing Facility of the Landar Industries, property of Sandra Seidlitz, taking equipments such as guns and other weapons. They said that the deal is sold for an underground movement called 'The Dark Crusade' whose actions has been growing more and more violent every recurssions.\n<br>\n<br>One of our members; Seline, is said to be acquainted with Royd Calixto, and her reaction in meeting the man; a quick and abrupt death by a glaive to the chest, proved it and caused the man's demise. Seline said she apologizes for her lack of professionalism and asks for a leave for a time to clear her mind.\n<br>\n<br>With my concern, I contacted Madam Sylvia Loquintez, Seline's mother, and figured out, after an hour of ravage insults and mockery, that Royd Calixto is Seline's abusive father. After digging for more info, Royd is in deed, abusive, and abuse has been added to the list of charges he is now facing. Not that those would matter anymore, due to the fact that he is now dead. But with who Seline was back at the Institute, I think she gave him a safe exit from the much more frightening chapter that would have been the next one for his life.\n<br>\n<br>Berex Fritzie out.","id":"tl-00000","year":"1698","season":"3","day":"58"},{"date":"","name":"Some sort of implications","main":"daud","cont":"|c-maximus| started a thread with |c-daud|\n<br>TIME: 1697, Spring 8\n<br>\n<br>|i-maximus|: Hey... uh... is this a bad time?\n<br>|i-daud|: No... not really...\n<br>|i-daud|: I actually expected you to call.\n<br>|i-maximus|: You did?\n<br>|i-daud|: Well.\n<br>|i-daud|: Since you hate me I kinda expected the worst... and that you'd be mocking me right now.\n<br>|i-maximus|: oh.\n<br>|i-maximus|: yeah.\n<br>|i-maximus|: sorry.\n<br>|i-maximus|: But I haven't mocked you yet.\n<br>|i-maximus|: So...

AND IT WAS GREAT!\n<br>\n<br>Everything seem so different from what I am familiar with. The houses, the roads, the people! Everything is so gorgeous, so dark, and so unique! I like how the houses are much smaller, slicker, and stacks on top of each other with different colors. They don't follow a single color scheme at all! I like how the roads and walls are painted and marked by amazing and colorful images. Which is something you wouldn't see back up there! I also like how the people, even though rude, are so lively and active!\n<br>\n<br>Anyway, our first mission was about this girl who was gone missing for two days. Her name is Maca. Her father, a metal smith, contacted us about the disappearance of his daughter who was only supposed to buy something - some condiment? - from the nearby shop. So, logically, my team - TEAM TORNADO - went to this 'nearby shop' which is totally not nearby at all and asked Mr. Remy, the shop owner, about Maca's whereabouts. As he speaks, his words and expressions only become more and more distant and it was clear that he was lying. Despite our lack of warrant, I asked my teammate - Ismael I think - who can shirk himself, to investigate the house by every corner while Kilosh and I try to make ourselves look clueless about Mr. Remy's actions. So, only for a short time, Ismael discovered a trace of blood on the walls which is covered by a carpet rug. Ismael revealed himself and Mr. Remy quickly dashed to his sort of amazing sword and everything went nuts. Kilosh went full jiujitsu on Mr. Remy while I run towards the wall to see the blood in slow motion. Ismael pulled the rug in a matter of less than a second which covered him out of my sight and made the background of my shot running in action a lot more awesome. As Kilosh counter Mr. Remy's blade slash with her super cross daggers technique, I kicked the bloodied wall with full force. IT WAS A DOOR ALL ALONG! Quickly, I drew light from the other room and blasted it into the room through the broken wall/door and was shocked because of what I saw!\n<br>It was a bunch of perverted paintings of Maca.\n<br>\n<br>After I vomited my delicious lunch into the floor for straight three minutes and Ismael raising his eyebrows at Mr. Remy for five and Kilosh looks severely disgusted in the distance, Maca revealed herself from the bed, covered by sheets, on the side of the room. She was selling herself to help her father with the expenses. And the blood. The blood was something... not to be worried about anyway... it's also kinda disgusting so it's better not to think about it.\n<br>\n<br>It's was a good day at the end tho. Maybe not a very happy ending, but happy nevertheless.\n<br>\n<br>So that's how my day went!\n<br>Goodnight Neopolitan!","id":"tl-00007","year":"1696","season":"2","day":"34"},{"id":"tl-00078","year":"1696","season":"2","day":"2","name":"Cold Summer","main":"kianna","cont":"[INTERVIEW] <b>Exclusive: Interview with our new Winter Wraith: Kianna Halley</b>\n<br>INTERVIEWER: |c-karen|\n<br>INTERVIEWEE: |c-kianna|\n<br>TIME: 1695, Fall 2\n<br>\n<br>|i-karen|: Good morning citizens of Mirrorplane, this is Karen of the Dominioneer and we are at the Cathedral of the Children of Mandalas with an exclusive interview with our brand new Winter Wraith, Miss Kianna Halley.\n<br>|i-karen|: So.

This letter is sent to let you know about it.
