  		name: 'Creation',
		icon: 'ra ra-frostfire',
  		des: 'The second basic technique of Rudimenti is the creation of something that can be called a material; a rock for example. People say the being able to do this is what makes a better Rudimenti, though it pretty much relies on one\'s affinity which they have no control of.' }, 
  	{ 	id: 'duplication', 	
  		name: 'Duplication',
		icon: 'ra ra-two-hearts',
  		des: 'It is the technique of creating the same matter as the one the Mystic is currently in contact with, requiring minimal Myst use. And with Invorti around, rumor ties it as the origin of the said art.' },

			name: 'Germination',
			icon: 'ra ra-sprout',

			name: 'Formulation',
			icon: 'ra ra-sprout-emblem',

		// SIGIATI
		{ 	id: 'invocation', 
			name: 'Invocation',
			icon: 'ra ra-explosion',
			des: 'Also; the power to do anything. Sigiati are people who the people consider as only a level below the Weaver.' },

	// CIRKUNESI

		name: 'Manipulation',
		icon: 'ra ra-crystals',

	{ 	id: 'perception', 
		name: 'Perception',
		icon: 'ra ra-burning-eye',
		des: 'Another core technique of Cirkunesi is being able to "see" or "feel" their affinity with their mind. It\'s a technique that they are widely known for but in reality, only few actually possess the talent to do it.' },
	{ 	id: 'protection', 
		name: 'Protection',
		icon: 'ra ra-heavy-shield',
		des: 'Most Cirkunesi\'s first technique is the ability to resist their own affinity. It is actually how most Mystics, regardless of art, discover theirs.' },

		{ 	id: 'construction', 
			name: 'Construction',
			icon: 'ra ra-locked-fortress',
			des: 'The main difference between a Construkti and a regular Cirkunesi is their attention to detail, and their incredibly intricate way of manipulating their affinity.' },

			name: 'Extension',
			icon: 'ra ra-decapitation',

		name: 'Crystalization',
		icon: 'ra ra-diamond',
		des: 'The bread and butter of Extenebri is the ability to create anything out of Myst. Though limited with the same glass-like material, the versitality of shaping it into anything made it the most common form of Mystic Art since its inception.' },
	{ 	id: 'remotion', 
		name: 'Remotion',
		icon: 'ra ra-doubled',
		des: 'With the rising evidence of the existence of Vuidemorti, it is now called to poor man\'s version of it, as instead of completely creating an area void of Myst, it is simply the technique of moving the mass of Myst from one area to another, rendering those within the area weakened, but not Mystlocked.' },
