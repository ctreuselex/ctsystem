	<p class="head">ORIGIN</p>
	<p>It was first discovered by Frederick Lemaitre in the early 1600s during the rise of the Dominion. It's first use is in the creation of technology and can replicate the art of Mystics themselves which is now known as a separate art called "Tekinesi". Now, Extenebri is the practice of manipulating Myst itself which is what its original Mystic is known for later in his life.</p>
	<p class="head">PRACTICE</p>
	<p>It is the practice of manipulating Myst all by itself, whether be in it's gaseous-like form or a more practical, crystalized form. Extenebri rapidly climbed on the ranks of Myst manipulations since its discovery due to how much easier it is compare to other practices. Mystics, who are not able to identify their material affinity was able to quickly progress in the art which allowed even Mydows to discover their potential in Myst manipulations.</p>
	<p>Dominating the field, comes the manufacturers; who uses the endless posibility of Extenebri to create technology and encouraged the participation of Mystics and Mydows into joining the Institute and serve the city despite of their shortcomings.</p>
