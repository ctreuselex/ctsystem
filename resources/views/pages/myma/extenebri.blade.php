	<p class="head">ORIGIN</p>
	<p>It was first discovered by Frederick Lemaitre in the early 1600s during the rise of the Dominion. Its first use is with Lemaitre's development of the CTsystem, the creation of technology being able to replicate the art of Mystics themselves, this in itself became a separate art form known as: Tekinesi.</p>
	<p class="head">PRACTICE</p>
	<p>It is the art of manipulating Myst all by itself, whether be in it's gaseous-like form or a more practical, crystalized form. Extenebri rapidly climbed on the ranks of Mystical arts since its discovery due to how much easier it is compare to other practices. Mystics, who are not able to identify their material affinity was able to quickly progress in the art which allowed even Mydows to discover their potential in Myst manipulations.</p>
	<p>Dominating the field, comes the manufacturers; who uses the endless posibility of Extenebri to create technology and encouraged the participation of Mystics and Mydows into joining the Institute and serve the city despite of their shortcomings.</p>
