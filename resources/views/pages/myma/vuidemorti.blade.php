	<p>Is the practice of using Myst itself without a medium. Extenebrus used have affinities of their own but would have deteriorated in the process of training the practice. There are exceptions who were able to keep themselves affiliated but their sense over the medium is severely weakened. </div>
	<p>Extenebri is a style that mostly consist of Myst crystallization; creating weapons, objects, armors with Myst itself and fight off opponents with extreme versatility and unpredictableness. Its practice began from Frederick Lemaitre who first discovered that if one can sense Myst out of a medium, why not go further and pull that out of the medium and use the Myst itself as a weapon. It was a difficult task as Myst out of the medium means losing track of of it entirely, but Lemaitre was determined. He found a way to free himself of his affinity by draining his surrounding of it. Being once affiliated with fire, he stayed in a frozen room and attempted to connect himself to the Myst surrounding him inside in the heat inside him. It was a success, and he was a revolutionary. He then opened up the school of Extenebri within the Institute in hopes of spreading his discovery.</p>
	<p>Another practice of Extenebri is an even more uncommon one, called 'Voiding'. Voiding is the process of removing Myst from a particular area, preventing all Mystics from using it to their advantage or being 'Myst Locked' in Mystics' terms. Voiding is a recent discovery by an unknown Mystic/s. The first record of it's usage is within Aeros, thought the possibly of it being used even earlier is possible.</p>
